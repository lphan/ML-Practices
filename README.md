# ML-Practices (cont.)

## INTRO: 

as a person who is passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning so that I want to 'learn by doing' a framework layer in between many popular frameworks (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, statsmodels, Tensorflow, Spark, etc.). 
Shortly, 'Starts' is a Wrapper package with the functions which are written with simple code by re-applying of many other data analysis frameworks. 
 
- Person who want to learn by doing is able to have a first look into the data science picture  with little effort and overcome the raw-theories's barriers without having to go into technical detail.
- Person who want to analyse data and get the result/ information asap, but do not have much time to deal with the complexity of many different frameworks. 

"By taking a look on the real examples and see how data are being analysed, install the frameworks you need and do the similar ways like one of the examples, improve your result by transforming your ideas into the new functions you like."

- Finally, it's Open Source on Open Data. You can always extend/ change/ update this package 'Starts'

Loop_of_the_path_to_DataScience_and_MachineLearning:

	1. Study/ review the theories in Machine Learning from different Sources

	2. Implement/ improve the algorithm using Python3 and its frameworks 

	3. Analyzes the data from public sources (scikit-learn, UCI, Kaggle)

	4. Integrate the implementation into the package Starts

## Example of a analysis workflow: 
	cont.

## Status of the data analysis packages: On-going 

> 1_USGS: analyse Pesticide Use in Agriculture. Which compounds are used most frequently in the United States?

> 2_Titanic: predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

> 3_NOAA: analyse El Nino Dataset, Meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys in the equatorial Pacific

> 4_USGS: analyse the significant earthquakes, 1965-2016

> 5_SNAP: implement the interpretation of the 685nm peak in water-leaving radiance spectra in terms of fluorescence, absorption and scattering, and its observation by MERIS (J. F. R. Gower , R. Doerffer & G. A. Borstad), based on framework snappy

> 6_ITA: analyse the Earthquakes that hit Italy between August and November 2016

> 7_AIR: analyse Air Quality Data Set

> 8_ARO: analyse data given by CodeFights and Arundo

> 9_RECS: analyse data of restaurant and consumer and build a recommendation system

> 10_EY: analyse data about marriages and family in Germany from 1950 to 2015 and predict result in 2016 and 2017

> 11_MED: analyse digital data of long physical phenomenon

> 12_WHR: analyse the World Happiness Report, Happiness scored according to economic production, social support

> 13_FEMA: analyse data FEMA Federal Emergency management Agency about federal-disasters and firefighter-fatalities 

> 14_NSIDC: analyse data daily-sea-ice-extent NSIDC National Snow & Ice Data Center

### How-To: run the script .ipynb with jupyter notebook
data need to be downloaded from the reference link in x_foldername 

copy and overwrite the file config.ini and modify the data path accordingly.

jupyter notebook x_foldername/x_filename.ipynb
