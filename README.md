# ML-Practices
Loop_of_the_path_to_DataScience_and_MachineLearning:

	1. Study/ review the theories in Machine Learning from different Sources

	2. Implement/ improve the algorithm using Python3 and its frameworks 

	3. Analyse the data from public sources (scikit-learn, UCI, Kaggle)

	4. Integrate the implementation into the package Starts


Status of the analysed data packages: On-going updated

> 1_USGS: analyse Pesticide Use in Agriculture. Which compounds are used most frequently in the United States?

> 2_Titanic: predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

> 3_NOAA: analyse El Nino Dataset, Meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys in the equatorial Pacific

> 4_USGS: analyse the significant earthquakes, 1965-2016

> 5_SNAP: implement the interpretation of the 685nm peak in water-leaving radiance spectra in terms of fluorescence, absorption and scattering, and its observation by MERIS (J. F. R. Gower , R. Doerffer & G. A. Borstad), based on framework snappy

> 6_ITA: analyse the Earthquakes that hit Italy between August and November 2016

> 7_AIR: analyse Air Quality Data Set

> 8_ARO: analyse data given by CodeFights and Arundo

> 9_RECS: analyse data of restaurant and consumer and build a recommendation system

> 10_EY: analyse data about marriages and family in Germany from 1950 to 2015 and predict result in 2016 and 2017

> 11_MED: analyse digital data of long physical phenomenon

> 12_WHR: analyse the World Happiness Report, Happiness scored according to economic production, social support

> 13_FEMA: analyse data FEMA Federal Emergency management Agency about federal-disasters and firefighter-fatalities 

> 14_NSIDC: analyse data daily-sea-ice-extent NSIDC National Snow & Ice Data Center

### How-To: run the script .ipynb with jupyter notebook
> data need to be downloaded from the reference link in x_foldername 

> copy and overwrite the file config.ini and modify the data path accordingly.

> jupyter notebook x_foldername/x_filename.ipynb

> More information: check out package Starts
